# basic-angular-form

This is the very angular exercise. I basically understood the basic structure of an angular application.

I have created interface, model, event emitter and route too. I have also created service to handle the api request from the root level. 

I have also created api using express js and mongoose.

### What I learned?
1. Components
2. Services, Observable and Subscribe
3. Services, Models and interfaces
4. Passing data and events between parent and child components 
5. Creating api with express JS
6. Using Mongoose with express JS
